Remove any existing methods declared (the default ones are the methods in Mark Davies's 10-Spliced Surprise Major, though other collections are available too)\r\n1. Select the stage (i.e. Minor/Major/Royal/Maximus)\r\n1. Select the class (i.e. Surprise/Delight etc.)\r\n1. Click 'Load Method from Library' and find the method you want (hint: just start typing the name and it should appear)\r\n\r\nOK, now you're all set to start proving. Notice that the method you have selected will have been given a symbol (most likely its initial; e.g B for Bristol, C for Cambridge etc).\r\n\r\n1. In the 'Shorthand' box start typing some calls in (hhh is defined for you - click 'Generate' and see what it does...). Note that the shorthand tool uses the first method in the list.\r\n\r\nI'll leave you to play with that for a bit. Note that you can manually tinker withe the composition in the main box below. Indeed, that's how you will need to prove spliced, which leads me nicely on to...\r\n\r\n### Proving Spliced\r\nMuch like proving single methods, except that the Shorthand facility isn't of much use here (unless all your methods are in the same group, in which case you could use it to build the composition template, before swapping the methods in).\r\n\r\n1. Start by adding methods using the 'Load Method from Library' tool. Note that all the method symbols must be unique, so if you're proving a composition which has two methods starting with the same letter (London and Lincolnshire for example), denote a different letter to one of them, otherwise you'll get an error.\r\n2. Type out the composition in the main box. A standard 14 bob is denoted by a `/` and a 1234 single by a `;`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNNNN/BB/\r\nBNNWN/BBBB/\r\n\r\netc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nJSProve will prove the composition as you type.\r\n\r\n### Specifying your own calls\r\nYou may wish to change the default call type (from Plain Bob bobs and singles) or add your own. To do this, click the Calls tab. If you wish to continue using the Shorthand tool, make sure that you assign `/` for your bob and `;` for the single. You can have as many call types as you wish; though be sure to use unique symbols for them.\r\n\r\n### Specifying your own music\r\nJSProve will, by default, tell you all the 4-bell runs contained in the composition (both off the front and at the back) in a format like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n16:  6543****\r\n24:  ****3456\r\n18:  ****8765\r\n```\r\n\r\nas well as telling you if you've achieved some well-known changes if it's an 8-bell composition, i.e. Backrounds, Queens, Kings, Tittums and Whittingtons.\r\n\r\nOf course, you will want to specify your own tastes in music, rather than just settle with my own; so if, for example, you like CRU's, then we'd best get them added for you...\r\n\r\n1. Click the Music tab\r\n1. Start adding music patterns (one per line) in the box. As the example states, if you want a row ending with 4678, add `****4678` on one line.\r\n1. At present, there is no save functionality within JSProve, so if you want to keep your music preferences, I would suggest copying them and pasting them into a text file somewhere on your machine, and then load them in from that when you use JSProve.\r\n\r\n## Participating\r\nPlease fork the code from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/jwholdsworth/JSProve) and submit a pull request, specifiying what your change does.\r\n","google":"UA-4055572-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
