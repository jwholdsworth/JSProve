JSProve
=======
JSProve is a web-based peal proving program for even bell methods (single methods and spliced) from Minor to Maximus.

## Features
* Load methods in from the MicroSiril Libraries (or specify new methods yourself)
* Shorthand generator for single methods
* All the work checker and change of method counter
* Detailed music output
* Music can be specified, if the particular row or row type is not already included by JSProve

## Usage
### Getting JSProve
Either visit http://james.theholdsworths.org.uk/projects/jsprove/ for a hosted version, or download this source code as a Zip file (from the link above) and open 'index.html' in your favourite browser (NOT Internet Explorer please!).

### Proving a Single Method
On the 'Methods and Composition' tab,
1. Remove any existing methods declared (the default ones are Bristol, Cambridge and Yorkshire respectively)
1. Select the stage (i.e. Minor/Major/Royal/Maximus)
1. Select the class (i.e. Surprise/Delight etc.)
1. Click 'Load Method from Library' and find the method you want (hint: just start typing the name and it should appear)

OK, now you're all set to start proving. Notice that the method you have selected will have been given a symbol (most likely its initial; e.g B for Bristol, C for Cambridge etc).
1. In the 'Shorthand' box start typing some calls in (hhh is defined for you - click 'Generate' and see what it does...)

I'll leave you to play with that for a bit. Note that you can manually tinker withe the composition in the main box below. Indeed, that's how you will need to prove spliced, which leads me nicely on to...
